Pomodoro Timer is a time-management tool that utilizes timers to break down work into intervals and allows for timed breaks between work periods. This method of alternating shorter work periods with scheduled breaks can help improve the user's productivity. Using the provided buttons, the user is able to increase/decrease the time of their work period and their breaks. 

Work periods (referred to as focusing sessions) can be any duration between 5 minutes and 60 minutes, and can be adjusted by 5-minute increments. Break periods can be any duration between 1 and 15 mintues, and can be adjusted in 1 minutes increments.

When a focus or break session is in progress, the screen will display the time remaining and an associated progress bar. 

Future changes to the website will include styling.
